    //  In this video we are going to learn minimum spanning tree, which is more commonly used as MST.

    /*
      Spanning tree -> According to definition of spanning tree is that A tree in which we have N nodes and N-1 edges, & all nodes are reachable from each other.
                       means if we have a undirected weighted graph with N nodes and M edges and there is no any relation between N and M.
                       then after we have to make a tree which is connected with every node and there should N nodes, N-1 edges.
                       and any graph can have multiple spanning tree it will depend on that particular graph.

       -> So, basically we have to draw all the spanning tree and, we have to figure it out with minimum edges weights when we sum up all the edges weight.
       -> So, whichever isc having minimum edges weight that will be known as minimum spanning tree that is MST.
       -> And, we can also observe that in spanning tree, there is no any cycle means we can say that spanning trees are free from cycles.

       -> How do we find a mst for a given tree, so for this we have two algorithm-> Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's Algo(for this we have to know about Disjoint set).
